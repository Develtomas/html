			<p>As soon as Computerized Tomography or CT scans became accessible 
				in the 1970s, they reformed the practice of neurology. They did 
				the scans by transmitting x-ray streams all the way through the head 
				at different positions and accumulating the x-ray streams on the other 
				side that was not absorbed by the head.
